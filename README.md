## Experimenting 🧪
Note that the Hanabi extension is not even close to alpha quality.  
Nevertheless, the procedure is here for anyone who wants to experiment with Hanabi extension.

1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/jeffshee/gnome-ext-hanabi.git
```
2. Copy your video wallpaper to the `gnome-ext-hanabi/src/` directory, name it as `video.mp4`
3. Run the installation script (Require `meson` and `ninja-build`)
```
cd gnome-ext-hanabi/src
./install.sh
```
4. Restart GNOME Shell
5. Enable the Hanabi extension

If the GNOME shell keep crashing, you can try to disable the extension using tty (Ctrl+Alt+F3):
```
gnome-extensions disable hanabi-extension@jeffshee.github.io
```
